Statistics:

avgDegree = Extra column for avgDegree
sampleSize = Extra column for sampleSize
AP = Adjacency Precision
AR = Adjacency Recall
AHP = Arrowhead precision
AHR = Arrowhead recall
SHD = Structural Hamming Distance
E = Elapsed Time in Seconds

Parameters:

numRuns = 1

Simulation:

Load data sets and graphs from a directory.


Algorithms:

1. IMaGES for continuous variables (using the SEM BIC score)

Weighting of statistics:

U = 
    1.0 * f(AP)
    0.5 * f(AR)
    1.0 * f(AHP)
    0.5 * f(AHR)

Note that f for each statistic is a function that maps the statistic to the 
interval [0, 1], with higher being better.
